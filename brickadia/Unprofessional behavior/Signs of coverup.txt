The collective tell of the brickadia dev team is "they left for personal reasons" They did this with Aeonara and Port
Silencing, deletion, cutting off, telling people to not discuss it
Taking multiple hours or days to then come out with a statement basically saying "Oh it was nothing, people overblew this"
If it's really just nothing, why does it take so long to say anything about it? Why do you silence and cut off people asking questions about what you say is "nothing"?
Why do you only respond once the problem grows big enough?
