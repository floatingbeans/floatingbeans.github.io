Hello, thank you for your concern. We take these matters very seriously.

Last week a former developer, Port, briefly attempted to re-join our community after having had zero involvement for the past three years. After many sleepless nights to prepare for our release, one of our team members decided to greet them before we had a chance to internally discuss their return.

Because we have since tightened our safeguards, we quickly decided to ban Port due to their close association with Evar, whom we banned in 2020 for sharing sexualized drawings of minors.

Now, we also uncovered direct evidence that Port had actively supported those same drawings, confirming that our permanent ban was the correct action.

When Port voluntarily left the team in 2022, we had no indication of such involvement. The only messages weâ€™d seen were immature comments exchanged by Port while they were a minor. The newly surfaced material changes that assessment completely.

Our policy is straightforward: any support for sexual content involving minors, real or drawn, results in a permanent ban. No exceptions, no second chances.

If you ever encounter behavior that threatens the safety of our community, please tell us right away. We rely on your reports. You can reach us privately via email at support@brickadia.com.

Thank you for helping us keep Brickadia a safe place for everyone.
