<p style=" padding-left: 5%;">Robert M. Swanson, 26, of the first block of Strawberry Lane, was also charged with 50 counts of criminal use of a communication facility after investigators with the Internet Crimes Against Children task force reviewed files on his electronic devices.
According to an affidavit of probable cause for his arrest written by County Detective Lisa DeMartini:
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received a report from an anonymous caller purporting to be a 14-year-old girl that they had received an unsolicited picture from a man of his penis.
The caller identified the man as Robert Swanson, provided Swanson’s address, phone number and social media handles, and said he is also grooming other minors over Discord.
DeMartini confirmed the name and address provided, and visited Swanson at his home on Jan. 14 with fellow county Detective Christopher A. Tankelewicz.
When the detectives explained why they were there, Swanson immediately identified the 14-year-old anonymous caller by name and said he was aware of her age and location.
Swanson said he had spoken to the girl for a few months and that he “didn’t agree with societal rules.”
He noted that in the Bible, Mary was supposed to be 14 or 15 years old and that people are afraid of being labeled pedophiles.
As the discussion continued, Swanson referenced the late 18th century novelist Jane Austen, whose works often centered on young women being courted by or marrying significantly older men.
He also said that teens today have a lot of problems and cut themselves, but the ones he talked to have told him that they no longer wanted to cut themselves after speaking with Swanson and that he likes helping them.
Another ICAC member, Adams County Detective Eric Beyer, also spoke with the anonymous caller Jan. 15, who said she had met Swanson through Discord and that they had many mutual friends, which led to her accepting him as a “friend” there.
Shortly thereafter, she said Swanson began sending her “creepy” messages and images of his genitals. He also sent her images and videos of himself engaging with other underage girls, including one in which he lifted the shirt of a girl and exposed her breasts to the camera.
Swanson additionally discussed coming to meet the girl and sent her a sweatshirt, though she said they never met in person. The last messages she had received from him were one or two months prior, she said.
DeMartini received word from a Homeland Security Investigations special agent that a 13-year-old male reported Swanson requested sexually explicit images from him over Discord on Dec. 22.
DeMartini secured a search warrant for Swanson’s home, which was served Jan. 23 with the assistance of other county detectives, HSI agents and Upper Providence police.
During the search, Swanson provided a recorded statement in which he confirmed his Discord user name and provided more information about the 14-year-old.
He said they met online in July and that they had exchanged clothed pictures, but there are images of his genitals “being distributed on Discord servers” so she had seen what he looked like anyway. He said the pictures got on the server after he sent them to other people.
Swanson denied ever sending the girl anything, but had discussed sending her $100 a month and had tried to meet up with her. He said they were still in contact and that he would discuss “whatever” with people of any age, including sexual topics.
When asked about not agreeing with societal rules, Swanson said that 100 years ago, the age of consent in Delaware was 7 and in Pennsylvania the age was 12. He added that the lowest age someone could get married in the U.S. was raised from 14 to 18 in 2020.
Swanson said he “doesn’t go by the age, he goes by the person,” and had traveled to Poland a few years ago to meet someone who was 16 or 17.
Swanson said he had never seen child sexual abuse material on Discord and had not sent any such material to anyone else, but did not provide a passcode for his phone or laptop.
He said he does not have a particular interest in 14-year-olds, but does not have a problem talking to them and that “age doesn’t matter, it’s the girl.”
Swanson then argued that age is less significant than the “biological realities” of when people reach puberty, so that it would be pedophilic to have sex with a 17-year-old who had not begun menstruating, but the same would not be true for someone younger than that who had been menstruating for some years.
When asked if it would be OK with a 12-year-old girl if she had been menstruating since she was 9, he replied, “yes.”
Seized during the raid was a laptop, a thumb drive and a Mac Book, along with a copy of a Jane Austen book and “Lolita,” by Vladimir Nabokov.
Tankelewicz found more than 50 images and videos of child sexual material during a preview examination of the Mac Book, including victims as young as infants and toddlers.
The affidavit notes this is an ongoing investigation, given Swanson’s admission that he was still in contact with the 14-year-old even after becoming aware of her disclosure, as well as his alleged communications with other juveniles.
Swanson was preliminarily arraigned before Magisterial District Judge Michael A. Burns, who set bail at 10% of $200,000.
He is currently in custody at the George W. Hill Correctional Facility with a Feb. 6 preliminary hearing scheduled before District Judge Andrew Goldberg.</p>
